# Predicting-the-2023-Superbowl-Winner-with-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict which team will win the 2023 Superbowl. We analyzed past game data, player performance, and team characteristics to build a model that predicts the outcome with high accuracy. Our project demonstrates my skills in using data analysis and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

featured are 2 datasets and a python notebook file which can be viewed to analyse my findings please note i was able to successfully predict the winner to be Kansas City Chiefs as underdogs
