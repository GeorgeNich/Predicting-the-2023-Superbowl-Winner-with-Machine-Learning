# Predicting-the-2023-Superbowl-Winner-with-Machine-Learning
My project utilized machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of the 2023 Superbowl by analyzing past game data, player performance, and team characteristics. The project's thoroughness is demonstrated by the inclusion of two datasets and a Python notebook file, which showcase my advanced analytical techniques and attention to detail.



I am proud to report that the machine learning model accurately predicted the winner of the Superbowl, with the underdog Kansas City Chiefs emerging as the victors. This success highlights my expertise in using data analysis and machine learning to make informed decisions and predictions based on large datasets. My work serves as an example of how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems and can provide valuable insights to inform decision-making.
