# Predicting-the-2023-Superbowl-Winner-with-Machine-Learning
I utilized machine learning algorithms to predict the winner of the 2023 Superbowl by analyzing past game data, player performance, and team characteristics. By doing so, I was able to use advanced analytical techniques to uncover patterns and insights within large datasets that were not immediately apparent through traditional methods. The inclusion of two datasets and a Python notebook file demonstrate my thoroughness and attention to detail, ensuring that my findings are well-documented and replicable.


The findings of my analysis showed that the machine learning model accurately predicted the outcome of the 2023 Superbowl by identifying and utilizing relevant patterns in the past game data, player performance, and team characteristics. Specifically, the model successfully predicted the underdog Kansas City Chiefs as the winners of the Superbowl. This demonstrates my ability to use data analysis and machine learning to make informed decisions and predictions based on large datasets. My work serves as an example of how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems and can provide valuable insights to inform decision-making.
